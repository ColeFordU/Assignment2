This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of two data structures: a singly linked list and a stack using a vector.

Single Linked List
The Single Linked List class provides the following functionalities:

push_front: Adds an element to the front of the list.
push_back: Adds an element to the end of the list.
pop_front: Removes the element from the front of the list.
pop_back: Removes the element from the end of the list.
front: Returns the value of the element at the front of the list.
back: Returns the value of the element at the end of the list.
empty: Checks if the list is empty.
insert: Inserts an element at a specified position in the list.
remove: Removes an element from a specified position in the list.
find: Finds the position of the first occurrence of a specified element in the list.
Stack
The Stack class implements a stack of integers using a vector. It provides the following functionalities:

push: Adds an integer to the top of the stack.
pop: Removes the integer from the top of the stack.
top: Returns the value of the integer at the top of the stack.
empty: Checks if the stack is empty.
average: Calculates the average value of all integers in the stack.
Usage
To use this program, include the header.h header file in your C++ code. You can then create instances of the Single Linked List and Stack classes and perform various operations on them.
